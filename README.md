# Learning-Pandas
This is the first exercise we can solve on Pandas. I am attaching both the data files and workbook. It is based on, "How to win a DS competition" from Coursera. 

You can download the data files, change the directory address in the code, and start solving the exercise. We can discuss the solution, next week? 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Happy Coding! :)
